# Website description

A portfolio page to showcase my projects, professional skills and experience, resume, personalities & blog posts. 

## Purpose of the website

To help recruiters get an overview of my coding skills through the portfolio itself. Everything you need to know about my past projects, knowledge and experience. 

Hope to get more exposures by Twitter & GitHub followers and LinkedIn connections even if the recruiters do not get in touch the first time. 

Encourage recruiters to revisit for improved contents/coding skills & hopefully keep in view for more appropriate roles and future opportunities.
