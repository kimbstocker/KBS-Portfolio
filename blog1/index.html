                <p>Not many people believed it when I said I am going to quit my job and go back to study to become a
                    software engineer. A field that is completely disconnected from my qualification and existing
                    experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I cannot say that changing career was an easy move for me, not only because of the uncertainty a new career path brings but
                    also because of the feeling when you are out of your comfort zone and completely out of your depth
                    with everything around you. Going back to study, being unemployed for nearly a year is definitely
                    something I have not done for over a decade. But I know where my dreams and passion lie and I am glad that I did it. I always tell myself
                    that investing 1 year for the next 30 years of working life is a no brainer. It’s a good investment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The way I see it, Tech industry requires you to learn and evolve every day, no tasks this week are
                    the same as the next, new technology comes out almost every year and if you’re set in your ways and
                    don’t like changes or learning new things, you will not be able to survive it. I strongly believe I
                    have the personal qualities and ultimately what it takes to immerse myself and succeed in this
                    environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am proud to have gone back to study at the age of 37 (as a mum) and
                    overcome all the roadblocks along the way (the extremely challenging assignments in a short period of time,
                    the weekly quizzes, the exams, the late nights etc.). I honestly enjoyed and love the challenges, the bugs fixes and often thought to myself "why have I not done this earlier?" 
                    The best part was all of my hard work paid off at the end as I received great results for all my assignments, exam, and projects.
                    It is the ultimate proof that I do not give up easy and I believe that I have what it takes to
                    become a great software engineer. I am super excited to take on and solve real world problems in the years to come.
